## 🎖️ Your Mission Statement (Integrated Throughout)

> "I'm Paul Moore, a 90% disabled Marine Corps combat veteran who served three tours in Iraq. I've walked through the fire - PTSD, depression, anxiety, nightmares, anger issues, job losses, addiction, and homelessness.
>
> I created this resource hub because St. Louis has incredible veteran services, but they're scattered and hard to find when you're in crisis. This is a centralized hub for every veteran resource in the St. Louis region.
>
> Whether you're a combat veteran struggling with PTSD, experiencing homelessness, looking for employment, or battling mental health issues - you'll find the help you need here."

**Your tagline appears throughout:**
*"Still Fighting. Still Healing. Still Here."*
